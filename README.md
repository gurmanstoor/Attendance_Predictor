# **College Football Game Attendance Predictor**

With the 2022-2023 NCAA college football season beginning soon on December 16th, we will be using a linear regression machine learning model to analyze a dataset that encapsulates all college football game data from the year 2000 up until 2018. While this model can be used to predict many different variables, we will be using it to specifically predict game attendance.
